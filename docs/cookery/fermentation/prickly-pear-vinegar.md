**Prickly Pear Vinegar** is a naturally fermented, tangy, and brilliantly colored vinegar made from the juice of the *Opuntia* cactus fruit (*tunas*).  
It’s an excellent way to preserve leftover juice from jelly or syrup making, while creating a versatile product for **cooking, cleaning, and medicine**.  
The flavor is mild and fruity, with a hint of desert sweetness.

## 🍐 Juice Preparation

1. **Harvest ripe tunas** and clean by burning or peeling off glochids.  
2. **Simmer** with enough water to cover for 15–20 minutes.  
3. **Mash and strain** through fine mesh or cheesecloth.  
4. Cool to room temperature before fermenting.

> 🪵 *Juice from jelly or syrup making can be reused — the natural sugars help fermentation.*

## 🍶 Fermentation Process

### Step 1: Alcohol Stage (if using fresh juice)
1. Pour juice into a clean glass jar, leaving space at the top.  
2. Add 1–2 tablespoons of sugar or honey to encourage yeast.  
3. Cover with cloth and let sit at **room temperature (70–80°F)** for 1–2 weeks.  
4. Stir daily. You’ll see bubbling and a wine-like aroma — this is the natural yeast producing alcohol.

> Once bubbling stops, it’s ready for the vinegar stage.

---

### Step 2: Vinegar Stage
1. Add 1–2 tablespoons of raw vinegar (with mother) to the fermented juice.  
   - Or simply allow wild **acetobacter bacteria** to take hold naturally.  
2. Cover again with cloth for airflow and let sit **4–6 weeks**.  
3. Stir weekly and check for vinegar scent.  
4. When the taste is tart and sharp, strain and bottle.

> A thin film (“mother”) may form on the surface — this is normal and desirable.

## 🌞 Traditional Wild Method

If you don’t have starter vinegar, simply leave **strained juice** loosely covered in a warm, dark place.  
Wild yeasts first ferment the juice into alcohol, then acetobacter converts it into vinegar.  
This process takes **6–8 weeks** but requires no special ingredients.

> 🔸 *Traditional desert households would hang cheesecloth over the jar to keep out insects while allowing airflow.*

## 🧂 Flavoring Options

You can infuse the vinegar once fermentation is complete:

| Ingredient | Flavor |
|-------------|---------|
| **Cinnamon stick** | Warm and aromatic |
| **Garlic & chili** | Savory hot sauce base |
| **Lime peel** | Bright and citrusy |
| **Rosemary or sage** | Herbal culinary vinegar |
| **Honey (1 tbsp)** | Soothes acidity and adds depth |

Let infuse 1–2 weeks, then strain and bottle.

## 🫙 Bottling and Storage

1. Strain through cheesecloth to remove solids or “mother.”  
2. Pour into **sterilized glass bottles** and cap tightly.  
3. Label with date and type.  
4. Store in a **cool, dark place** — flavor improves with age.

> Properly stored vinegar will keep indefinitely.  
> The “mother” may reform in the bottle; this is harmless and can start your next batch.
