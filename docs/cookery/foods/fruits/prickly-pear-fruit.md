## 🔥 Removing Glochids

### Method 1: Flame Burn
- Hold each fruit over a **flame or coals** and rotate until tiny hairs burn off.  
- Wipe with a damp cloth.

### Method 2: Rub and Rinse
- Roll the fruit in **sand, gravel, or coarse cloth**, then rinse thoroughly.  
- Good for large batches in the field.

### Method 3: Peeling
- Slice both ends off, make a lengthwise slit, and peel off the thick skin with a knife.  
- Works best after removing the glochids by one of the methods above.

> 🔸 *Tip:* Always peel thicker than you think—you can’t see glochids easily in low light.
