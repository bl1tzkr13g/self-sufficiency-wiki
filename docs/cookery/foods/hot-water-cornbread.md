# Hot Water Cornbread

![Hot water cornbread cakes](cookery/foods/images/hot_water_cornbread.jpg)

Hot water cornbread is a traditional Southern dish made from simple ingredients — cornmeal, salt, hot water, and a little fat. It is quick to prepare, uses few utensils, and was a staple survival food in many households. Unlike oven-baked cornbread, these cakes are fried in a skillet, making them ideal when baking wasn’t possible.

- (Optional) 1 tsp sugar or chopped onions for flavor  

**Instructions:**
1. Mix cornmeal, salt, and optional sugar/onions in a bowl.

3. Stir in fat (or mix into skillet during frying).  
4. Shape into patties with wet hands or spoon directly into skillet.  
5. Fry in hot fat or oil until golden brown and crisp on both sides (about 2–3 minutes per side).
