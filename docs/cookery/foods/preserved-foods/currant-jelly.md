# Currant Jelly (Red, Black, or White)

Currant jelly is a traditional preserve made from currants of any color. Red currants give a tart, bright jelly, while black currants produce a darker, richer flavor. White currants are milder and sweeter.

## Ingredients
- 4 cups currants (red, black, or white)
- 4 cups sugar (equal weight to juice)
- Water (just enough to prevent scorching)

---

## Method
1. **Prepare Fruit**  
   Wash and remove stems. Place currants in a pot with a splash of water.

2. **Cook**  
   Simmer gently until currants burst and release juice (10–15 minutes).

3. **Extract Juice**  
   Strain through jelly bag or cheesecloth overnight.  
   *Tip: Do not squeeze the bag — this keeps jelly clear.*

4. **Cook Jelly**  
   - Measure juice and sugar (1:1 ratio).  
   - Return to pot, boil rapidly until jelly reaches gel point (220°F / 104°C).  
   - Skim foam as needed.

5. **Jar**  
   Pour into sterilized jars, leaving ¼ inch headspace. Seal and water-bath process 5 minutes.

## Storage
- Shelf-stable for 12 months if sealed.  
- Refrigerate after opening.

---

## Uses
- Spread on bread, toast, or pastries.  
- Classic with roasted meats (lamb, venison, pork).  
- Glaze for tarts, pies, and baked goods.

---

## Notes
- **Red currants**: High natural pectin, classic tart jelly.  
- **Black currants**: Richer, stronger flavor, sometimes use less sugar.  
- **White currants**: Delicate flavor, sweeter, lighter jelly.
