# Zante Currants – Dried Grapes

![Zante currants](cookery/food/preserved-foods/images/zante_currants.jpg)

Despite the name, **Zante currants** are not true currants (*Ribes* family berries). They are actually tiny, dried grapes from the **Black Corinth grape** (*Vitis vinifera*), a seedless variety. These currants have been grown since ancient times in Greece, especially on the island of Zakynthos (Zante), from which their name comes.  

They are often called **“dried currants”** in recipes and are used in baked goods, porridges, and trail rations.
