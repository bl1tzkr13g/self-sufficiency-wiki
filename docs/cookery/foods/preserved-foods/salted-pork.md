## Overview
Salted pork is one of the oldest preservation methods for meat. By heavily salting cuts of pork, moisture is drawn out, inhibiting bacterial growth and allowing the meat to be stored for long periods without refrigeration. It was a staple in seafaring, military rations, and frontier living.

## Traditional Method

1. **Select the Meat:**  
   Pork belly, shoulder, or side cuts were commonly used. Fatty cuts tended to last longer.

2. **Prepare the Salt:**  
   Large amounts of coarse non-iodized salt were used. Sometimes saltpeter (potassium nitrate) was added to help preserve color and inhibit botulism.

3. **Salting Process:**  
   - Rub each piece thoroughly with salt.  
   - Lay pieces in a wooden barrel or stone crock in alternating layers of meat and salt.  
   - Cover the top layer completely with salt.  
   - Store in a cool cellar or aboard ship.

4. **Storage:**  
   Meat could be kept for months, sometimes years, though it often required soaking before cooking due to high salt content.
