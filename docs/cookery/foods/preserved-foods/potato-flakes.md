# Potato Flakes

Potato flakes are dehydrated, cooked potatoes that can be reconstituted quickly with hot water or milk. They are lightweight, long-lasting, and excellent for survival storage or trail rations.

## How to Make Potato Flakes

### Ingredients
- Fresh potatoes (starchy types like Russets work best)
- Water
- Optional: salt, butter, milk (for flavor before drying)

### Method
1. **Wash & Peel**  
   Wash thoroughly, peel if desired (skins can add texture but shorten storage life).

2. **Cook Potatoes**  
   Boil or steam until soft. Avoid over-salting the cooking water.

3. **Mash**  
   Mash thoroughly until smooth (a ricer works best). Add only small amounts of water or milk if needed.

4. **Spread Thin**  
   Spread mashed potatoes in a thin, even layer on dehydrator trays (or parchment-lined oven sheets).

5. **Dry**  
   - **Dehydrator**: 135–145°F (57–63°C), 8–12 hours, until fully dry and brittle.  
   - **Oven**: Lowest setting, prop door open, dry until crisp.

6. **Flake**  
   Break dried sheets into flakes. A food processor can make finer flakes.

## Storage
- **Container**: Airtight jars, Mylar bags, or vacuum-sealed pouches.  
- **Environment**: Cool, dark, and dry place.  
- **Shelf Life**: 1–2 years (room temp), up to 10+ years in oxygen-free sealed Mylar with desiccant/oxygen absorbers.

## Uses
- **Instant Mashed Potatoes**: Reconstitute with boiling water or milk.  
- **Thickener**: Add to soups, stews, and gravies.  
- **Baking**: Adds fluffiness to bread, rolls, and gnocchi.  
- **Emergency Rations**: Lightweight and calorie-dense.

## Notes
- Avoid adding butter, milk, or fat before drying if long-term storage is the goal (fats go rancid).  
- For extended survival storage, keep plain. Add seasonings after rehydration.
