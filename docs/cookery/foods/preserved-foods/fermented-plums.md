## How to Make Fermented Plums  

1. **Ingredients**  
   - Fresh ripe plums (firm, not bruised).  
   - Non-chlorinated water.  
   - Salt (2â€“3% brine solution).

2. **Steps**  
   - Wash plums gently.  
   - Place in sterilized glass jars or ceramic crocks.  
   - Pour brine solution over plums until fully submerged.  
   - **Place a fermentation weight (glass, ceramic, or food-safe stone) on top to keep plums under the brine.**  
   - Cover with cloth or fermentation lid (allowing gas release).  
   - Ferment at cool room temperature (55â€“65Â°F / 13â€“18Â°C).  
   - Fermentation time: 1â€“4 weeks depending on taste.  

3. **Storage**
