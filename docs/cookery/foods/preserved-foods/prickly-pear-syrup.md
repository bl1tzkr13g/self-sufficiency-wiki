4. **Simmer 20 minutes**, stirring occasionally, until fruit softens and releases juice.  
5. **Mash gently**, then strain through cheesecloth or fine mesh sieve.  
6. Let the juice **settle or strain again** for a clear syrup base.

> 🔸 *Tip:* For the richest flavor and color, use fruit that’s freshly harvested and not overripe.

3. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer 15–25 minutes until slightly thickened.
