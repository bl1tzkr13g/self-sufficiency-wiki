## 🍐 Preparing the Juice

1. **Harvest and clean fruit:**  
   Select fully ripe tunas (deep red or purple).  
   Remove spines and glochids by flame, rubbing, or peeling.

2. **Chop and simmer:**  
   - Slice fruit into chunks (no need to peel further).  
   - Place in pot with just enough water to prevent scorching.  
   - Simmer 15–20 minutes until soft.

3. **Extract the juice:**  
   - Mash gently with a potato masher.  
   - Strain through cheesecloth or a fine sieve.  
   - Let drip—do not press, or the jelly will turn cloudy.  

> 🪵 *Tip:* The juice should be clear and jewel-colored. Strain twice for the brightest result.

2. Add **½ cup lemon juice** and **pectin**; stir well.

4. Add **sugar all at once** and stir constantly.

## 🫙 Canning Instructions

1. **Sterilize jars** in boiling water for 10 minutes.  
2. **Ladle jelly** into hot jars, leaving ¼ inch headspace.  
3. **Wipe rims**, apply lids and rings finger-tight.  
4. **Process in boiling water bath** for 10 minutes (adjust for altitude).  
5. Remove and let cool 12–24 hours.  
6. Check seals — lids should not flex up and down when pressed.

> Store sealed jars in a cool, dark place. Once opened, refrigerate.

## 🔥 Alternative: No-Pectin Version

Traditional jelly makers often used long boiling to thicken instead of commercial pectin:

- Increase juice to 3 cups and sugar to 4 cups.  
- Add 2 tablespoons of lemon juice.  
- Boil until the liquid “sheets” off a spoon (about 30–40 minutes).  
- Pour into jars and seal as above.

> This yields a slightly softer, more old-fashioned jelly texture.

## 🧂 Flavor Variations

- Add **1 teaspoon vanilla** for a smoother flavor.  
- Add **½ teaspoon cinnamon** for warmth.  
- Substitute part of the lemon juice with **lime** for brightness.  
- Combine prickly pear and **apple juice** for extra pectin and a subtle floral taste.

## ⚠️ Notes and Tips

- Avoid aluminum pots — acid and heat can discolor the jelly.  
- Overripe or under-ripe fruit may cause poor setting.  
- If the jelly doesn’t set, reheat with an extra ½ packet of pectin and reprocess.  
- For syrup instead of jelly, skip the pectin and reduce sugar slightly.
