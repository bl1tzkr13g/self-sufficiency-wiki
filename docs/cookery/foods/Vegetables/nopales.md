The **pads of the prickly pear cactus** (*Opuntia spp.*) are known as **Nopales**.

When properly prepared, they have a tart, green-bean-like flavor and a texture similar to okra.

## 🌵 Identification

- **Plant:** Prickly Pear cactus (*Opuntia spp.*)  
- **Part Used:** Young pads (cladodes)  
- **Appearance:** Flat, oval, green, covered in spines and fine barbed hairs called **glochids**  
- **Best Harvest Time:** Spring to early summer, when pads are tender and 4–8 inches long  

> ⚠️ *Avoid pads with visible hard spines or woody texture—they will be fibrous and bitter.*

## 🧤 Harvesting Nopales

1. **Choose young pads:**  
   Look for the shiny, light-green new growth at the top of the cactus.
2. **Use tongs or thick gloves:**  
   Never handle with bare hands—tiny glochids embed in skin and are hard to remove.
3. **Cut at the joint:**  
   Slice the pad cleanly at its base where it joins the next segment.
4. **Collect in a bucket or basket**, keeping them upright to avoid punctures.

> 🔸 *Tip:* Harvest early in the day when pads are full of moisture.

## 🔥 Removing Spines and Glochids

There are several ways to safely clean Nopales:

### Method 1: Scrape
- Hold the pad flat on a cutting board.  
- Use a **sharp knife** or spoon to scrape off all spines and bumps.  
- Rinse thoroughly afterward.

### Method 2: Burn
- Pass the pad quickly over an **open flame** or hot coals to burn off glochids.  
- Wipe with a damp cloth or scrape remaining spots.  

### Method 3: Peel
- Slice the pad’s edge and peel off the outer skin layer.  
- Best for older, thicker pads.

## 🔪 Preparation
