# Barley Flatbread 🍞🌾

![Barley flatbread](cookery/images/barley_flatbread.jpg)

**Barley Flatbread** is one of humanity’s oldest foods — simple, hearty, and sustaining.  
Made from ground barley meal, water, and salt, it was a staple for travelers, farmers, and early settlers.  
Unlike wheat, barley has little gluten, so it doesn’t rise — making it perfect for **flatbreads, bannocks, and campfire breads** in survival settings.

## 🥣 Instructions

### 1. Mix the Dough
1. Combine barley flour and salt in a bowl.  
2. Add water gradually while stirring until it forms a soft, slightly sticky dough.  
3. Add fat if available — this improves flexibility and flavor.  
4. Knead lightly (barley lacks gluten; do not overwork).

### 2. Shape the Bread
- Divide dough into small balls (about palm-size).  
- Flatten into discs ⅛–¼ inch thick.  
- Dust lightly with flour to prevent sticking.

### 3. Cook
Choose one of the following:

#### 🔥 Campfire Stone
- Heat a clean, flat stone near campfire coals.  
- Lay bread directly on the hot surface.  
- Cook 3–5 minutes per side until brown spots appear.

#### 🍳 Skillet or Pan
- Heat dry or lightly greased skillet.  
- Cook each side until golden (about 2–3 minutes per side).  

#### 🔥 Oven or Stove
- Bake on a hot baking sheet or griddle at 400°F for 10–12 minutes.  
- Flip halfway through for even browning.

> 💡 If the bread cracks, add a bit more water. If sticky, dust with extra flour.
