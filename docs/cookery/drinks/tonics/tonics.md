# Tonics 🥄🌿

![Herbal tonic jars](cookery/images/tonics.jpg)

**Tonics** are restorative beverages or extracts made from herbs, roots, fruits, or tree parts steeped in **water, vinegar, honey, or alcohol** to draw out their nutrients and medicinal compounds.  
They are designed to **nourish, strengthen, or rebalance** the body over time rather than provide immediate relief like a medicine.

In survival and homestead traditions, tonics were an essential part of year-round health — taken daily or seasonally to keep up strength, immunity, and vitality when fresh foods were scarce.

## 🌿 What is a Tonic?

A **tonic** is any mild preparation taken regularly to support overall wellness.  
Unlike strong herbal medicines or teas for specific ailments, tonics are **gentle, nourishing, and preventative**.

They often contain:
- **Vitamins and minerals** from plants or trees  
- **Antioxidants** and **essential oils**  
- **Mild bitters** to aid digestion  
- **Natural acids or sugars** for preservation  

> 💡 *Tonics build resilience — they “tone” the system, rather than treat disease.*
