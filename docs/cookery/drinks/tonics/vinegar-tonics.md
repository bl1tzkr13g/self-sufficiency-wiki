**Vinegar tonics**, also known as **oxymels**, are traditional medicinal drinks made by combining **apple cider vinegar, honey, and herbs**.

## 🌿 What Is an Oxymel?

The word *oxymel* comes from Greek — “**oxy**” (acid) + “**mel**” (honey).  
It describes any **herbal infusion preserved in vinegar and honey**.  
This combination extracts **vitamins, minerals, and volatile oils** from plants, while the natural acids and sugars prevent spoilage.

> 💡 *An oxymel is both food and medicine — sweet enough to take daily, strong enough to heal.*
