# Root Tonics 🌱🥄

![Root tonics](cookery/images/root_tonics.jpg)

**Root tonics** are nutrient-rich brews made by simmering the roots of medicinal or edible plants to extract their minerals, bitters, and oils.  
They were used by herbalists, pioneers, and native peoples to **cleanse the blood, restore energy, and strengthen the body** through seasonal changes or recovery.

Roots form the foundation of many long-standing tonic traditions — from burdock and dandelion to ginger and ginseng.

## 🌿 What Are Root Tonics?

Root tonics differ from leaf or flower teas because roots require **heat and time** to release their compounds.  
They are made as **decoctions** — a slow simmer of plant roots in water — or as **vinegar or honey infusions** for long storage.

> 💡 *Roots are the plant’s storage organs — they hold minerals, starches, and medicinal compounds vital for survival.*
