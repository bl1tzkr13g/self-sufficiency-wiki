# Herbal Tonics 🌿🥄

![Herbal tonics](cookery/images/herbal_tonics.jpg)

**Herbal tonics** are gentle, nourishing herbal preparations taken regularly to build strength, resilience, and balance in the body.  
Unlike medicines that treat symptoms, tonics work slowly — **feeding, cleansing, and fortifying** the system over time.

They were a cornerstone of traditional and homestead health care, often taken daily in tea, honey, or vinegar form to maintain wellness through the seasons.

## 🌼 What Are Herbal Tonics?

A **tonic** strengthens rather than stimulates.  
It nourishes, supports, and restores natural function instead of forcing change.  
Most tonics are made from herbs that are **rich in vitamins, minerals, and trace nutrients** — making them valuable survival and long-term health tools.

> 💡 *Tonics are “slow medicine” — their effects are steady, cumulative, and balancing.*
