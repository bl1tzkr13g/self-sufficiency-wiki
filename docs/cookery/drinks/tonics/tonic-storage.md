# Tonic Storage & Preservation 🧴🌿

![Tonic storage jars](cookery/images/tonic_storage.jpg)

Proper storage and preservation of tonics ensures that your **herbal, root, evergreen, and syrup preparations** stay safe, potent, and usable through every season.  
In traditional homesteading and survival practice, how you store a tonic was as important as what it was made from.

This guide covers **drying herbs, preserving tonics**, and **long-term storage methods** for honey, vinegar, syrup, and fermented bases.

## 🌿 Drying Herbs for Tonics

Drying herbs preserves their nutrients and flavor for later infusions or decoctions.

### Air Drying
1. Bundle herbs loosely with string or twine.  
2. Hang upside down in a **warm, dry, shaded** area with good airflow.  
3. Dry until crisp — 3–10 days depending on humidity.  
4. Store in paper bags or glass jars away from sunlight.

> 💡 Avoid direct sun drying — UV light destroys essential oils and vitamins.

### Dehydrator or Oven
- Use lowest setting (90–110°F / 32–43°C).  
- Dry until leaves crumble and roots snap cleanly.  
- Cool before sealing to prevent moisture buildup.

### Best Herbs for Drying
Nettle • Lemon Balm • Mint • Raspberry Leaf • Chamomile • Dandelion Root • Burdock • Pine & Spruce Tips (for winter use)

## 🍯 Storage by Base Type

| Base | Container | Shelf Life | Storage Location |
|------|------------|-------------|------------------|
| **Honey-Based Tonic** | Glass jar with tight lid | 12+ months | Cool, dark shelf |
| **Vinegar (Oxymel)** | Glass bottle, non-metal lid | 6–12 months | Pantry or cupboard |
| **Syrup (Sugar or Honey)** | Sealed jar or swing-top bottle | 3–6 months | Refrigerator or cool cellar |
| **Water Infusion / Tea** | Glass or ceramic container | 1–2 days | Refrigerated only |
| **Fermented Tonic (e.g., fire cider, mead)** | Swing-top or corked bottle | 6–12 months | Cool, dark shelf |
| **Dried Herbs** | Airtight glass jar or tin | 12–18 months | Dark, dry location |

> Once opened, tonics last longer if refrigerated and sealed tightly.

## 🔥 Preservation Methods

### Water Bath Canning (Syrups & Sweet Tonics)
1. Pour hot syrup into sterilized jars, leaving ½ inch headspace.  
2. Seal with canning lids.  
3. Process 10 minutes in boiling water bath.  
4. Cool and store in dark place up to 1 year.

### Alcohol Preservation
- Add ¼ cup high-proof alcohol (like brandy) per pint of syrup for long storage.  
- Keeps tonics shelf-stable and prevents mold.

### Vinegar Preservation
- Apple cider vinegar naturally prevents bacterial growth.  
- Ensure all plant matter is fully submerged.  
- If a “mother” forms, strain and rebottle — it’s harmless.

### Honey Preservation
- Raw honey self-preserves — use only dry utensils when scooping.  
- Crystallized honey can be gently warmed to liquefy without harm.

## 🧊 Freezing Tonics

For delicate tonics that lose flavor over time (like lemon balm or mint tea):
- Pour into ice cube trays and freeze.  
- Store cubes in sealed freezer bags for up to 6 months.  
- Melt one cube into hot water as needed.

> *Useful for summer cooling tonics or quick winter immune teas.*

## 🧪 Fermented Tonics

Some tonics (like **fire cider**, **ginger bug**, or **wild kvass**) are **self-fermenting** if left uncooked.

### Storage Tips
- Use swing-top or corked bottles to release pressure safely.  
- Keep cool and out of sunlight.  
- Burp bottles weekly if fermentation continues.  
- Fermented tonics keep 6–12 months unopened, 2–3 months after opening.

## 🏷️ Labeling & Rotation

**Always label jars with:**
- Name of tonic  
- Ingredients used  
- Preparation method (tea, syrup, vinegar, etc.)  
- Date made  
- Best-by estimate  

> Mark “R” on lids for refrigerator-only items, and “P” for pantry-safe.

### Rotation Tip
Follow the **“first in, first out”** rule — always use the oldest batch first.  
Check every few months for cloudiness, mold, or off-smells.

## ⚠️ Signs of Spoilage

| Type | Warning Signs | Action |
|------|----------------|--------|
| **Syrup** | Mold, fizzing, or cloudy layer | Discard immediately |
| **Vinegar Tonic** | Strange film or color change | Strain, reboil, or discard |
| **Fermented Drink** | Overpressure, strong sour odor | Burp or refrigerate |
| **Honey Tonic** | Fermentation (bubbles, separation) | Safe if not moldy; refrigerate |

> Never consume moldy or unknown growth — even natural ferments should smell pleasant.

## 🪵 Survival Notes

- **Vinegar and honey** tonics are the most reliable long-term storage types — safe, portable, and resistant to spoilage.  
- Dried herbs are lightweight and **reconstitute easily** with hot water in the field.  
- In cold climates, tonics can be **stored in root cellars or snow pits** wrapped in cloth.  
- Labeling and rotation ensure no tonic is wasted over long winters.  
- Alcohol or vinegar can **double as disinfectants** in emergencies.
