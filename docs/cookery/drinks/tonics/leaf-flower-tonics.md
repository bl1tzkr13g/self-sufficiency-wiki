# Leaf & Flower Tonics 🌿🌼

![Leaf and flower tonics](cookery/images/leaf_flower_tonics.jpg)

**Leaf and flower tonics** are gentle, nourishing infusions made from the above-ground parts of plants — leaves, buds, and blossoms.  
They are rich in **vitamins, minerals, and plant compounds** that strengthen the body over time.  

These tonics were part of daily life for homesteaders and herbalists, used for **hydration, calm, digestion, and nutrient support**, and are among the simplest tonics to make in the wild.

## 🌿 What They Are

Leaf and flower tonics differ from strong medicinal teas — they are meant to **nourish and balance** rather than treat.  
Most can be taken freely, much like a daily drink or gentle tea, to provide steady nutrition and internal balance.

> 💡 *These are the “maintenance herbs” — mild enough for daily use, strong enough to make a difference.*
