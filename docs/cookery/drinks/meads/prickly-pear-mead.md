## 🍯 Making the Must

The **must** is the sweet liquid mixture that will ferment into mead.

1. In a large pot or fermenter, combine:
   - Prickly pear juice  
   - Honey  
   - Lemon juice  
   - Enough water to bring total volume to 1 gallon  
2. Stir until honey fully dissolves.  
3. Taste — it should be **sweet but tangy**; adjust with more honey or lemon.  
4. When cooled to room temperature (below 90°F), add yeast and nutrient if using.

## 🍷 Fermentation Process

### Primary Fermentation
1. Pour into a glass jug or ceramic crock, leaving 2–3 inches headspace.  
2. Cover with cloth or use an airlock.  
3. Keep in a **cool, dark place (65–75°F)**.  
4. Stir daily for the first 5–7 days.  
5. When bubbling slows, strain if pulp remains and transfer to a clean jug.

### Secondary Fermentation
1. Attach airlock and let ferment **4–6 more weeks** until clear and no bubbles remain.  
2. Rack (siphon) off sediment into clean container.  
3. Repeat after another month if needed for clarity.

> 🪵 *Fermentation time can vary by temperature and yeast type. Wild ferments may take up to 10 weeks.*

## 🧂 Finishing and Bottling

1. When fermentation is complete, taste for sweetness.  
   - For a dry mead, leave as-is.  
   - For a sweeter mead, dissolve ¼–½ cup honey in warm water and stir in before bottling.  
2. Bottle into sterilized wine bottles or swing-top jars.  
3. Age for **at least 3 months** before drinking; flavor deepens and smooths over time.  
4. Store in a cool, dark location.

## 🌶 Variations

| Type | Ingredients / Notes |
|------|----------------------|
| **Spiced Mead** | Add cinnamon stick, clove, or ginger during fermentation |

| **Sparkling Mead** | Bottle just before fermentation completes (caution: pressure build-up possible) |
| **Desert Blend** | Add ½ cup prickly pear syrup for color and sweetness after fermentation |
| **Mixed Fruit Mead** | Combine prickly pear juice with apple, pomegranate, or grape juice |

## 🍾 Aging and Storage

- Store bottles upright for 2 weeks, then on their sides if corked.  
- Best flavor develops after **6–12 months**.  
- Shelf life: **2+ years** in a cool, dark place.  
- Opened bottles should be refrigerated and used within 1 week.

> Over time, the color may deepen from bright magenta to rose or amber — this is normal.
