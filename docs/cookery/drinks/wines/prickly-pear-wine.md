**Prickly Pear Wine** is a desert delicacy — a lightly sweet, floral, and vividly colored wine made from the fruit (*tunas*) of the *Opuntia* cactus.  
It can be made using traditional natural fermentation methods or with added wine yeast for a more controlled result.  
The wine ranges from bright pink to deep ruby red, depending on the fruit and concentration.

## 🍷 Fermentation (Modern Yeast Method)

1. In a sanitized 1-gallon fermentation jug or crock, mix:
   - 3 quarts juice  
   - 1 gallon total liquid with water added  
   - 1½–2 lbs sugar  
   - Lemon juice (for acidity)
2. Stir until sugar dissolves.  
3. Add yeast nutrient and yeast (optional for reliability).  
4. Cover with a cloth or airlock and let ferment in a **cool, dark place (60–75°F)**.

### Primary Fermentation
- Stir daily for 5–7 days.  
- When bubbling slows, strain again to remove pulp and transfer to a clean jug with airlock.

### Secondary Fermentation
- Let sit **4–6 weeks** until fermentation stops and sediment settles.  
- Rack (pour off the clear wine, leaving sediment behind).  
- Repeat after 1–2 months for clarity.

> 🔸 *The wine may appear bright magenta at first, deepening to rose or ruby as it ages.*

## 🍇 Wild Fermentation (Traditional Method)

If yeast is unavailable, prickly pear juice will **ferment naturally** due to wild yeasts on the fruit skins.

1. Use unwashed (but cleanly harvested) ripe fruit.  
2. Simmer gently, strain, and let cool.  
3. Add sugar and lemon juice as above.  
4. Cover loosely with cloth and allow fermentation to start naturally (2–4 days).  
5. Continue as with modern method, but fermentation may take longer (up to 8 weeks).  

> *Wild fermentation produces a rustic, slightly unpredictable flavor but works reliably in warm climates.*

## 🧂 Finishing & Bottling

1. Once fermentation has completely stopped (no more bubbles, clear liquid), rack again.  
2. Sweeten to taste if desired (optional: add ¼ cup sugar per gallon).  
3. Bottle into sterilized wine bottles or jars and cork or cap tightly.  
4. Age at least **3 months** for smoother flavor; 6–12 months for full development.

## 🍾 Variations

| Style | Description |

## 🍶 Storage and Preservation

- Store bottles upright for 2 weeks, then on their sides in a cool, dark place.  
- Ideal cellar temperature: **50–60°F**.  
- Properly sealed bottles last 1–2 years; flavor improves with age.  
- Opened bottles should be refrigerated and consumed within 1 week.

> The color may fade with time but remains flavorful and aromatic.
