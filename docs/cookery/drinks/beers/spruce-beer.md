## Overview
Spruce beer is a fermented (or sometimes non-alcoholic) beverage made from the young shoots or essence of spruce trees. It was widely brewed in North America and Europe from the 16th–19th centuries and was prized for its medicinal qualities, especially as a source of Vitamin C to prevent scurvy among sailors.  

It can be mildly alcoholic if fermented, or simply a sweet herbal soda if consumed quickly.

- Molasses imparts a dark, robust flavor, while sugar makes a lighter drink.
