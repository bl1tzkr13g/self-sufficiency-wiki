*Cookery / Drinks / Preservation*

Beer is one of humanity’s oldest and most widespread drinks. In the 18th century, it was more than a recreational beverage—it was a **daily survival necessity**. Unsafe water sources and the dangers of hard liquor meant beer filled a vital role as a safe, nourishing alternative.

## Beer as Survival Drink  
- **Unsafe water**: Many rivers, wells, and ponds carried disease. Boiled ingredients in brewing meant beer was sterilized without brewers understanding why.  
- **Nutrition & strength**: Workers drank beer with breakfast and lunch, often as part of their wages. Many believed it had health-giving properties.  
- **Military rations**: Sailors and soldiers were given up to a gallon of beer a day. If beer was unavailable, substitutes like watered rum ([Grog](grog.md)) were issued.  
- **Child & family drink**: Weak “table beers” and “small beers” (often under 1% alcohol) were consumed by children and women.

## Types of 18th Century Beer  
- **Strong Beer** – up to 8% alcohol.  
- **Common Beer** – 3–4%.  
- **Table Beer** – about 1%.  
- **Small Beer** – very weak, barely alcoholic, but safe to drink.  

Brewing methods then were far less efficient. Yeasts were wild or borrowed from bakers, sugar extraction was poor, and sanitation was inconsistent. Recipes often “worked” by accident, relying on old yeast clinging to casks.

## Regulation & Substitutes  
Because beer was central to society, brewers were often **regulated by law**. Some shortcuts, like brewing with molasses, were banned or tightly controlled because they undercut more traditional malt-based beers.  

Home brewing, however, was common. With a pot, a barrel, and access to yeast, nearly every household could make beer.

## Molasses Beer (18th Century Recipe)  
One of the simplest colonial beers was **Molasses Beer**, even recorded by George Washington in the 1750s.  

**Original recipe (1790):**  
> “Take 5 lbs of molasses, half a pint of yeast, a spoonful of powdered ginger. Add 2 gallons scalding water, then 13 gallons cold. Let ferment 12 hours. Bottle with a raisin in each.”  

**Modernized version (1–2 gallons):**  
- 2 gallons water  
- 1 lb unsulfured molasses (avoid blackstrap)  
- 1 tbsp grated ginger root  
- 1 packet brewer’s yeast (or baker’s yeast in a pinch)  

**Method:**  
1. Bring water & molasses to ~200°F for 15 minutes to sterilize.  
2. Add ginger. Cool to ~70–75°F.  
3. Pitch yeast on top. Cover loosely, allow to ferment 12–24 hrs.  
4. Drink “green” as a mild, sweet beer, or bottle with a raisin for natural carbonation.  

This beer spoils quickly—drink within a week.

## Beer vs. Other Drinks  
- **Beer** was safer than water and healthier than gin.  
- **Cider** and **Spruce Beer** were also common.  
- Beer without hops spoils faster—hops serve as a natural preservative.
