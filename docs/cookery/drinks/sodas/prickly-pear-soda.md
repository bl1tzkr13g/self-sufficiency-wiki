It’s naturally carbonated through wild or added yeast fermentation and offers a healthy, desert-inspired alternative to commercial sodas.

## 🍐 Preparing the Juice

1. **Clean the fruit:** Remove glochids by burning, rubbing, or peeling.  
2. **Slice and simmer** in a small amount of water (10–15 minutes).  
3. **Mash** to extract juice and strain through a fine cloth or sieve.  
4. Combine strained juice with water, sugar or honey, and lemon juice in a clean glass or ceramic jar.

> 💡 *Aim for a bright, sweet liquid — sweetness fuels the fermentation and carbonation.*

## 🍹 Fermentation

### Option 1: Wild Fermentation
1. Mix juice, water, and sugar in a wide-mouth jar.  
2. Cover loosely with cloth or paper towel to allow airflow.  
3. Stir once daily.  
4. Within 1–3 days, small bubbles will appear, indicating fermentation.  

### Option 2: Starter Fermentation
1. Add ¼ cup **ginger bug**, **kombucha**, or **whey** for reliable results.  
2. Stir and cover with cloth.  
3. Ferment 2–4 days until lightly tangy and bubbly.

> 🔸 *If the liquid smells pleasant and slightly yeasty or fruity, it’s fermenting correctly.*

## 🫧 Bottling and Carbonation

1. Strain the liquid into clean swing-top or soda bottles.  
2. Leave about 1 inch of headspace in each bottle.  
3. Seal tightly and leave at **room temperature for 1–3 days** to carbonate.  
4. Check bottles daily by gently opening one — when fizzy, refrigerate immediately.  
5. Serve chilled over ice or mix with sparkling water.

> ⚠️ **Always refrigerate once carbonated** — natural sodas can overpressurize if left warm too long.

## 🧂 Tips for Success

- If fermentation is slow, add a few raisins — they introduce natural yeast.  
- Do not use chlorinated water — it can inhibit fermentation.  
- Overfermentation causes vinegar flavor; refrigerate once mildly tangy.  
- Color may fade slightly with time but flavor intensifies.

## 💊 Benefits

## ⚠️ Safety Notes
- Always **“burp”** bottles once daily during carbonation to prevent pressure buildup.  
- If mold appears (fuzzy or colored growth), discard and start again.  
- Store finished soda refrigerated — drink within 1–2 weeks.  
- Do not ferment in metal containers.
