## 🌿 Harvesting & Preparation

1. Gather **young, bright-green pine needles**.  
2. Remove any brown or woody parts.  
3. Rinse gently in cold water.  
4. Chop roughly to release more flavor and vitamin C.  

---

## 🍹 Making the Base

1. Bring 1 quart of water to a **light simmer** (not boil).  
2. Add chopped pine needles and steep for 15–20 minutes.  
3. Remove from heat and add the remaining cool water to make 1 gallon total.  
4. Stir in sugar or honey until dissolved.  
5. Add lemon juice and let the liquid cool to room temperature.  

> *The steeped tea should taste slightly tart and citrusy, not bitter.*

## 🍯 Fermentation

### Option 1: Wild Fermentation
1. Pour the cooled sweet pine infusion into a glass or ceramic jar.  
2. Cover with a breathable cloth or paper towel.  
3. Leave at **room temperature (65–75°F)** for 2–3 days.  
4. Stir daily — you should notice small bubbles forming.  

### Option 2: Starter Fermentation
1. Add ¼ cup of **ginger bug**, **kombucha**, or **whey** to the sweetened infusion.  
2. Cover loosely with cloth and let sit 1–2 days.  
3. Once it smells lightly yeasty and citrusy, strain out solids.

> ⚗️ The longer it ferments, the more tangy and less sweet it becomes.

## 🫧 Bottling and Carbonation

1. Strain the liquid through a fine cloth or sieve.  
2. Pour into **swing-top bottles** or recycled soda bottles.  
3. Seal tightly and let sit at **room temperature for 1–3 days** to carbonate.  
4. Check daily — once fizzy, refrigerate immediately.  
5. Serve chilled over ice.

> ⚠️ Always refrigerate once carbonated — natural sodas can overpressurize if left warm.
