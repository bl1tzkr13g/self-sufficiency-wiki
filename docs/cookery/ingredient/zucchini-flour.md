## Overview
**Zucchini flour** is made by drying and grinding zucchini (courgette) into a fine powder. It is not a grain-based flour but a vegetable flour, often used as a low-carb, gluten-free alternative in baking or as a nutritional thickener. It allows surplus zucchini harvests to be preserved in a compact, long-lasting form.

## Making Zucchini Flour

### Traditional/Home Method
1. **Slice:** Wash and slice zucchini into thin rounds or strips.  
2. **Dry:**  
   - Air dry in the sun (covered with mesh against insects).  
   - Use a dehydrator.  
   - Or dry in a low oven.  
3. **Grind:** Once fully dry and brittle, grind into powder using a mortar and pestle, coffee grinder, or food processor.  
4. **Store:** Keep in airtight containers away from moisture.

## Preservation & Storage

## Notes
- Unlike wheat flour, zucchini flour has little gluten and cannot rise on its own — it’s best blended with other flours.  
- Good way to use excess zucchini harvests, which are notorious for overproducing.  
- Similar methods can be applied to pumpkin, sweet potato, or carrot flours.
