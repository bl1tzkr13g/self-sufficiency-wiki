## Overview
**Flour** is a powder made by grinding grains, legumes, nuts, or roots. It is one of the oldest and most important ingredients in human diet and survival, serving as the foundation for bread, porridges, pastes, and preserved foods. Different flours have different nutritional values, textures, and preservation properties.
