## Overview
Salt (sodium chloride) is one of the oldest and most important minerals in human history. Beyond its flavoring role, salt has been central to food preservation, trade, and survival. By drawing out moisture, salt prevents bacteria from thriving, making it essential for curing meats, fermenting, and pickling.

## Types of Salt

### 1. Rock Salt (Halite)
- **Source:** Mined from underground deposits and ancient seabeds.  
- **Uses:** Historically for preservation and de-icing; large crystals often crushed before culinary use.  
- **Preservation:** Can be used in curing if ground and purified.

### 2. Sea Salt
- **Source:** Harvested from evaporated seawater.  
- **Uses:** Common in cooking and preservation. Available in coarse or fine crystals.  
- **Preservation:** Ideal for brining meats and vegetables. May contain trace minerals.

### 3. Kosher Salt
- **Source:** Refined salt with large, flaky crystals.  
- **Uses:** Named for its use in koshering meat (drawing blood).  
- **Preservation:** Excellent for curing and brining due to easy handling and dissolving.

### 4. Pickling Salt
- **Source:** Highly refined salt, free from additives like iodine or anti-caking agents.  
- **Uses:** Specially for canning and pickling.  
- **Preservation:** Prevents cloudiness in brines, dissolves evenly.

### 5. Himalayan Pink Salt
- **Source:** Mined from ancient deposits in the Himalayas (Pakistan).  
- **Uses:** Culinary and decorative. Contains trace minerals like iron.  
- **Preservation:** Can be used but more expensive; historically not common.

### 6. Fleur de Sel
- **Source:** “Flower of salt,” skimmed from the surface of salt ponds in France and elsewhere.  
- **Uses:** Finishing salt.  
- **Preservation:** Not traditionally used; too delicate and costly.

### 7. Iodized Table Salt
- **Source:** Refined salt with added iodine (for preventing goiter) and anti-caking agents.  
- **Uses:** General household salt.  
- **Preservation:** **Not recommended** for curing or pickling; additives may cause off flavors and cloudy brine.

## Salts Used for Preservation

- **Best Choices:**  
  - Sea salt (unrefined or refined)  
  - Kosher salt  
  - Pickling salt  
  - Rock salt (if ground/purified)

- **Avoid:**  
  - Iodized table salt (additives interfere with curing and pickling)  
  - Fancy finishing salts (Fleur de Sel, flake salts) due to cost and limited quantity

## Preservation Techniques Using Salt
- **Dry Salting / Dry Curing:** Packing meats in salt to draw out moisture (e.g., salted pork, salt cod).  
- **Brining:** Dissolving salt in water for preservation and flavoring (e.g., pickles, corned beef).  
- **Fermentation Aid:** Provides selective environment where beneficial microbes thrive (e.g., sauerkraut, kimchi).

## Notes
- Always use **non-iodized salt** for preservation.  
- Grain size affects curing speed — coarse salts dissolve slower, fine salts pack tighter.  
- Salt has historically been as valuable as gold, driving trade and settlement.
