## What is Suet?  

Suet is the **hard, raw fat** from beef or mutton, specifically from around the **kidneys and loins**. Unlike softer fats (like lard or tallow), suet has a high melting point and firm texture, which historically made it ideal for long-lasting storage, pastry making, and food preservation.  

When rendered (melted and strained), suet becomes **tallow**, a shelf-stable fat used in both cooking and non-food survival applications.

2. **Processing:** Finely chopped or shredded; often rendered immediately.  
3. **Preservation:** Rendered suet (tallow) sealed in crocks or jars; melted suet sometimes used to seal jars of food.  
4. **Uses:** Potted meats, portable soup, pemmican, puddings; plus candles, lamp oil, soap.
