## What is Tallow?  

Tallow is **rendered beef or mutton fat**, usually made from **suet** (the hard fat around kidneys). Once melted down and strained, it becomes a shelf-stable, waxy fat that was historically central to cooking, lighting, and survival.  

Unlike raw suet, tallow does not spoil quickly when stored properly, making it one of the most important traditional fats.
