# **Hard Crack Stage**

The hard crack stage is the final stage of heating sugar syrup, achieved at a temperature of approximately 300°F to 310°F (149°C to 154°)

At this point, the syrup has a sugar concentration of about 99% and nearly all the moisture has been cooked out. This results in candies that are hard, solid, and brittle when cooled. 

## **The cold water test**
Before thermometers were widely available, candy makers would test the syrup by dropping a small amount into a bowl of very cold water. For the hard crack stage, the syrup will immediately solidify into hard, brittle threads that snap easily when bent.

**Tips for reaching the hard crack stage**
- **Use a candy thermometer:** For the most reliable results, a digital candy thermometer is recommended for precise temperature control.
- **Do not stir:** Once the sugar and water mixture comes to a boil, you should stop stirring to avoid crystallization.
- **Heat evenly:** Using a heavy-bottomed pot and controlling the heat will prevent the sugar from burning, which can happen before the hard crack stage is reached.
- **Work quickly and carefully:** The syrup is extremely hot and hardens very fast once it's removed from the heat. Take great caution to avoid burns.
