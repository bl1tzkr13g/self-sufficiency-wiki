## What is Potted Beef?
Potted Beef is a savory meat paste (akin to pâté or rillettes) traditionally made by slow‑cooking beef, pounding it very fine, seasoning warmly (salt, pepper, mace, nutmeg), then packing it into small earthen pots and sealing with rendered fat. The solid fat lid excludes air and slows spoilage.

**Why it works:** low oxygen under a hard fat cap + salt + thorough cooking. Traditionally kept in a cool pantry or cellar; today we use refrigeration or freezer for safety.

## Ingredients (Base Formula)
- 2 kg (4½ lb) beef (shin/shank, chuck, brisket, or other collagen‑rich cut)
- 300–450 g (10–16 oz) beef dripping, [[Suet]], or [[Clarified Butter]]/[[Ghee]] (divided; some for the paste, some for the sealing cap)
- 18–22 g fine salt (≈ 1 Tbsp; adjust to taste)
- 2–3 tsp black pepper, freshly ground
- Optional, classic warm spices: ½–1 tsp grated nutmeg, ¼–½ tsp ground mace, pinch of clove
- Optional aromatics: 1 bay leaf, small onion, thyme sprig (for the braise)

> **Scaling rule:** For every 1 kg cooked, drained beef, plan ~120–180 g melted fat to blend + ~2–3 mm (⅛ in) fat to seal each pot.

---

## Equipment
- Heavy pot or Dutch oven **or** pressure cooker/Instant Pot
- Sieve/colander and a wooden spoon (or stand mixer/food processor)
- Small ramekins or jars (4–8 oz)
- Small saucepan to melt/clarify fat
- Probe thermometer (target temps in steps)

## Method 1 — Old‑Fashioned (Braise + Pounding + Suet Seal)
This mirrors 18th–19th‑century kitchen practice.

1. **Braise:** Cut beef into large chunks. Add to a heavy pot with just enough water to come halfway up the meat, add bay/onion/thyme if using. Salt lightly. Simmer very gently (barely bubbling) until spoon‑tender, 3–4 hours. Aim for internal temp ≥ **90–95 °C (195–203 °F)** for collagen breakdown.
2. **Drain & reduce liquor:** Lift meat out. Strain cooking liquor and simmer to a syrupy glaze (optional but tasty). Reserve.
3. **Pound fine:** While warm, shred meat, then pound in a mortar or beat with a stand mixer paddle until very fine. Work in the reduced liquor (a few spoonfuls), salt, pepper, and warm spices.
4. **Beat in fat:** Melt **beef dripping/suet** until clear (see [[Rendered Fat]]). Beat ~10–15% by weight into the meat until spreadable but not greasy. Taste and adjust seasoning.
5. **Pot it:** Pack tightly into scrupulously clean, warm ramekins, tapping to remove air pockets. Level the surface.
6. **Seal:** Pour a **2–3 mm (⅛ in)** layer of *hot* melted suet or dripping over the surface to form a solid cap. Do not mix it in. Let set firm.
7. **Store:** Cover and keep **as cool as possible**. Historically: cool pantry/cellar. Modern guidance below.

**Texture target:** smooth, cohesive, spoon‑spreadable; not crumbly, not oily.

## Method 2 — Modern Stove/Oven (Food Processor + Butter/Ghee Seal)
1. **Cook:** Season beef cubes with salt/pepper. Brown lightly in a little fat, then add water to barely cover. Oven‑braise at **150 °C / 300 °F** until very tender (2½–3½ h) **or** pressure‑cook 45–60 min with natural release.
2. **Process:** Drain (reserve juices). Pulse beef in a processor with just enough juices to loosen. Add spices. With machine running, stream in **clarified butter/ghee** until spreadable.
3. **Pack & seal:** Pack into warm jars/ramekins, tap out air, then seal with **melted clarified butter** (2–3 mm). Chill until the cap is fully solid.

> **Tip:** Clarified butter/ghee makes a cleaner‑tasting seal than whole butter because milk solids are removed (less prone to rancidity). See [[Clarified Butter]].

## Method 3 — “Shelf‑Stable Base” (Pressure‑Can Plain Beef, Pot When Opened)
> **Why this approach:** High‑fat pastes are **not** recommended for home canning because fat can interfere with heat penetration. A safer compromise is to pressure‑can *lean cubes/strips* of beef in broth. Later, open a jar, drain, and *then* pound with fat and spices and seal under butter for short‑term storage.

**Summary:** Pack hot, lean beef in boiling broth into jars, remove bubbles, leave proper headspace; **pressure‑can at 10–15 psi** according to altitude and jar size per tested [[Pressure Canning]] guidance for plain beef. Store sealed jars cool and dark. When needed, convert to potted beef using **Method 2, Step 2–3**.

## Preservation & Storage
**Choose one or combine:**

- **Fat Cap + Refrigeration (recommended):** Under an intact fat seal and kept **≤ 4 °C / 40 °F**, quality is best for **2–4 weeks**. Always use clean utensils; re‑melt and re‑seal after each use if the surface is exposed.
- **Fat Cap + Freezer:** Pack, seal, chill until firm, then freeze. Keeps **4–6 months**. Thaw in fridge. Texture remains excellent.
- **Cool Cellar (traditional):** Historically kept in cool larders. For modern safety, only do this if your cellar averages **< 10 °C / 50 °F**; limit to **up to 1 week** and monitor closely. For long storage without refrigeration, use **pressure‑canned plain beef** (see Method 3) and make potted beef fresh as needed.

> **Never water‑bath can potted beef.** It is low‑acid and fat‑rich; **botulism risk** exists without adequate heat. See [[Botulism]] and [[Pressure Canning]].

**Integrity checks:**
- Fat lid must be **continuous**, no cracks, no meat protruding.  
- Discard if you see gas, mold, off‑odors, or a broken seal with warm storage history.

---

## Flavor Variations
- **Pepper & Mace (Georgian classic):** black pepper + nutmeg + mace.  
- **Horseradish & Mustard:** fold in grated horseradish and dry mustard after pounding (serve fresh; don’t seal long‑term with raw horseradish).  
- **Thyme & Port:** reduce a splash of [[Fortified Wine|Port]] with the pan juices before blending (keep alcohol modest for preservation balance).  
- **Chili & Smoked Salt:** modern twist for sandwiches.

---

## Serving Ideas
- Spread on hardtack, oatcakes, or toasted bread.  
- Melt a spoonful into gravy or enrich stews.  
- Pack in hand pies with diced pickles.

---

## Troubleshooting
- **Greasy / separating:** Too much fat blended in. Re‑chill, beat in a little reduced broth, repack, reseal.  
- **Dry / crumbly:** Add warm clarified butter or reduced broth and beat smooth.  
- **Seal cracks on chilling:** Warm the surface briefly and pour a thin fresh layer of fat to repair.  
- **Dull flavor:** Don’t under‑salt. Warm spices (nutmeg/mace) make it taste “authentic.”

## Food Safety Notes (Home & Field)
- Use clean, heat‑safe containers. Sterilize if storing more than a few days.  
- Keep below **4 °C/40 °F** whenever possible; limit time in the *danger zone* (5–60 °C / 41–140 °F).  
- For off‑grid: pair with an **evaporative cooler/zeer pot**, spring house, or shaded cellar, and keep portions small to finish quickly.  
- When in doubt, **discard**—meat preserves are high‑risk foods.
