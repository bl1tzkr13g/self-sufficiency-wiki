## ðŸ“œ Root Cellars Quick Reference (Printable Card)

**What it is:**  
A traditional underground or partially buried storage space that uses the earthâ€™s natural insulation to keep food cool, dark, and humid.  

**What itâ€™s for:**  
- Long-term storage of root vegetables (potatoes, carrots, turnips, beets).  
- Preservation of fruits (apples, pears).  
- Storage of canned goods, cured meats, and some beverages.  

**Why it works:**  
- Stable underground temperatures (32â€“50Â°F / 0â€“10Â°C).  
- High humidity prevents wilting.  
- Darkness slows sprouting and spoilage.

## Building a Root Cellar  

1. **Site Selection**  
   - North-facing slope or shaded area preferred.  
   - Well-drained soil (avoid flooding).  

2. **Construction Methods**  
   - Dug directly into earth.  
   - Stone, brick, or concrete walls for stability.  
   - Earth covering for insulation.  

3. **Ventilation**  
   - Essential to prevent mold and regulate temperature.  
   - Typically two vents: one near floor (air intake), one near ceiling (air exhaust).  

4. **Shelving & Storage**  
   - Wooden shelves for jars and canned goods.  
   - Wooden bins filled with sand or sawdust for root crops.  
   - Hanging racks for onions and garlic.

## Food Storage Guidelines  

- **Potatoes** â†’ store in boxes or bins, keep in darkness to avoid greening.  
- **Carrots, Beets, Parsnips** â†’ buried in damp sand or sawdust.  
- **Apples** â†’ store separately (they release ethylene gas, causing other produce to spoil faster).  
- **Onions & Garlic** â†’ hung in mesh bags in drier section.
