## ðŸ“œ Zeer Pot Quick Reference (Printable Card)

**What it is:**  
A traditional evaporative cooling device made by nesting two clay pots with wet sand between them.  

**What itâ€™s for:**  
- Preserving vegetables, fruits, and dairy in hot climates.  
- Extending shelf life without electricity.  

**Why it works:**  
- Water in the sand evaporates through the outer potâ€™s porous surface.  
- Evaporation draws heat away, cooling the inner pot.

## Historical Use  

- Originated in Northern Africa and the Middle East.  
- Used in desert regions for centuries to keep produce fresh.  
- Allowed storage of perishable goods where ice was unavailable.  

---

## Modern Use  

- Still used in rural Africa, India, and by off-grid communities.  
- Eco-friendly and sustainable alternative to refrigeration.  
- Effective in dry, arid climates (less effective in humid regions).

## What It Can Store  

- **Tomatoes** â†’ up to 20 days (vs. 2â€“3 days without).  
- **Eggplants, peppers, leafy greens** â†’ last much longer than at ambient temps.  
- **Milk & cheese** â†’ stay fresh for several days longer.  
- **Fruits like apples, guavas, pears** â†’ extend storage time noticeably.  

---

## What NOT to Store  

- **Bananas, mangoes, and papayas** â†’ release too much ethylene gas, causing other foods to spoil.  
- **Onions and garlic** â†’ prefer dry storage, will rot in the damp cellar conditions.  
- **Potatoes** â†’ will sprout or rot quickly in humid sand-cooled environment.  
- **Citrus fruits** â†’ skins soften and mold in high humidity.  
- **Overripe produce** â†’ accelerates spoilage of everything else.
