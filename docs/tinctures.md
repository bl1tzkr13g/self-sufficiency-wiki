# Tinctures

A **tincture** is a concentrated herbal extract where plant material is macerated in a solvent—commonly [[alcohol]].

## Basic Method
1. Chop fresh or dried herb; note its water content.
2. Combine with solvent (e.g., 1:5 w/v with 40–95% ethanol).
3. Seal, shake daily for 2–4 weeks.
4. Strain, bottle in amber glass, label (plant, ratio, solvent, date).

!!! note "Non‑alcohol options"
    Glycerites (vegetable glycerin) and acetum (vinegar) are alternatives, but shelf life and extraction spectrum differ.

## Use & Storage
- Shelf life typically years when stored cool, dark, and sealed.
- Dose varies by herb—consult plant page (e.g., [[skirret]] or others) for specifics.
