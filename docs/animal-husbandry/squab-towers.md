## ðŸ“œ Squab Towers Quick Reference (Printable Card)

**What it is:**  
A purpose-built tower or house designed to shelter pigeons, traditionally for producing squab (young pigeons) and collecting manure.  

**What itâ€™s for:**  
- Meat production (squab is tender and high in protein).  
- Fertilizer (pigeon manure, called guano, is nutrient-rich).  
- Sustainable, low-input livestock option.  

---

## Historical Use  

- Common in the Middle East, North Africa, and Europe since antiquity.  
- Squab was a delicacy in ancient Rome and medieval Europe.  
- Towers could house hundreds to thousands of birds.  
- Pigeon guano was highly valued as fertilizer and even for saltpeter production.  

---

## Modern Use  

- Still used in parts of the Middle East and rural areas.  
- Revived by permaculture and homesteaders as a sustainable protein source.  
- Less common in the West due to changing food preferences.

## How Squab Towers Work  

1. **Design**  
   - Tall stone, brick, mud, or adobe towers.  
   - Rows of niches or compartments inside for nesting pairs.  
   - Small entry holes for birds to fly in and out.  

2. **Breeding**  
   - Pigeons mate and raise squabs (harvested at ~4 weeks old).  
   - A tower supports continuous breeding cycles.  

3. **Harvesting**  
   - Squabs are removed before fledging (tender meat, high fat).  
   - Guano collected from tower floor for fertilizer.

## How to Build a Squab Tower  

1. **Site Selection**  
   - Elevated, dry ground to avoid flooding.  
   - Away from dense trees (to reduce predator access).  
   - South-facing entrances in cold climates; shaded in hot climates.  

2. **Foundation & Structure**  
   - Traditional: circular or square tower, 3â€“10 meters tall.  
   - Materials: stone, brick, adobe, or concrete blocks.  
   - Walls thick enough to insulate against heat/cold.  

3. **Nesting Niches**  
   - Rows of compartments built into the inner walls.  
   - Each niche ~8 in (20 cm) wide Ã— 12 in (30 cm) deep.  
   - Provide at least 1,000 niches for large towers, or fewer for small-scale.  

4. **Entrances & Perches**  
   - Small round or square holes (3â€“4 in / 7â€“10 cm wide) spaced along upper walls.  
   - Ledges or wooden perches outside holes help birds land.  

5. **Roofing**  
   - Conical or flat roof, often with a central ventilation hole.  
   - Protects from rain while allowing airflow.  

6. **Interior Maintenance**  
   - Floor sloped or removable trays for guano collection.  
   - Access hatch for farmers to enter, clean, and harvest squabs.

## Advantages  

- Requires little feed (pigeons forage).  
- Produces both meat and fertilizer.  
- Low maintenance once established.  

---

## Challenges  

- Vulnerable to predators if not secured.  
- Disease risk if hygiene not maintained.  
- Less cultural acceptance of eating pigeon in some regions.
