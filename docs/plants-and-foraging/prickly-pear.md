## 🔪 Harvesting and Preparation

### Pads (Nopales)
1. Harvest **young, tender pads** in spring or early summer.  
2. Use tongs or gloves to avoid spines.  
3. Scrape or burn off all spines and glochids.  
4. Slice into strips or cubes.  
5. Boil for 10–15 minutes, then rinse to remove the sticky sap.  
6. Eat plain, or fry with onions, eggs, or beans.

> 🪵 *Tip:* Lightly grilling the pads reduces slime and enhances flavor.

### Fruit (Tunas)
1. Harvest fruit when fully colored and slightly soft (usually late summer).  
2. Use tongs to twist fruit off the pad.  
3. Remove spines and glochids by:
   - Rolling on sand or gravel  
   - Burning them off over a flame  
   - Peeling thickly with a knife  
4. Eat raw or process into juice, jam, syrup, or fermented drinks.

## 🌱 Propagation

1. Cut a pad and allow it to dry for several days until a callus forms.

3. Water sparingly until roots form, then let nature handle the rest.

> Prickly pear spreads easily—avoid planting near paths or livestock areas.

## ⚠️ Cautions
- Glochids are **microscopic spines** that can cause painful skin irritation. Handle with thick gloves.  
- Avoid overconsumption of fruit at once—can have a mild laxative effect.  
- Some species have inedible or bitter fruit—test small amounts first.
