# Currants – Red, Black, and White

![Currants](plants-and-foraging/images/currants(2).jpg)

Currants are small, tart berries that grow in clusters on woody shrubs of the genus *Ribes*. They are prized for jams, jellies, cordials, and medicinal uses. Three main types are cultivated or foraged: **red currants**, **black currants**, and **white currants** (a color variation of red currant).

## 🌱 Identification

### Red Currants (*Ribes rubrum*)
- **Appearance:** Small, bright red, translucent berries growing in hanging clusters.  
- **Leaves:** Broad, lobed (maple-like), serrated edges, bright green.  
- **Taste:** Tart and juicy, often used for jelly and sauces.  
- **Season:** Ripen midsummer (June–July).  

### White Currants (*Ribes rubrum var. alba*)
- **Appearance:** Pale cream to translucent white berries, sometimes pinkish.  
- **Leaves:** Same as red currant (they are a variant).  
- **Taste:** Sweeter and milder than red currants.  
- **Season:** Ripen midsummer.  

### Black Currants (*Ribes nigrum*)
- **Appearance:** Dark purple to black berries in clusters.

## 🌍 Where They Grow
- **Climate:** Prefer cool, temperate regions. Hardy shrubs tolerant of frost.  
- **Soil:** Moist, well-drained soil rich in organic matter.  
- **Sunlight:** Partial to full sun (do best with morning sun and afternoon shade).  
- **Distribution:**  
  - Native across Europe and northern Asia.  
  - Cultivated in North America, though some states historically restricted black currant due to white pine blister rust.  
  - Thrive in northern U.S., Canada, and cooler European climates.

## 🍴 Uses
- **Red currants:** Jellies, sauces, syrups, wine.  
- **White currants:** Fresh eating, desserts, garnish, sweet preserves.  
- **Black currants:** Juices, cordials (e.g., cassis), jams, medicinal syrups.

## 🌿 Preservation
- **Jelly & Jam:** Currants are high in natural pectin.  
- **Drying:** Less common but possible with black currants.  
- **Freezing:** Berries can be frozen whole for later use.  
- **Fermentation:** Used in wine, cordials, and vinegar.

✅ **Note:** Don’t confuse currants (*Ribes* species) with “Zante currants,” which are actually dried grapes (raisins).
