## Planting
- **When to Plant**: Plant bare-root currant bushes in early spring or late fall while dormant.
- **Soil Needs**: Moist, well-drained soil, pH 5.5–7.0. Currants tolerate heavier soils better than many fruits.
- **Spacing & Depth**: Space bushes 4–5 feet apart in rows 6–8 feet apart. Plant at same depth as nursery.
- **Sun & Water**: Prefer partial shade to full sun in cooler climates. Require steady moisture, especially while fruiting.

## Growing
- **Maintenance**:  
  - Prune yearly to remove old wood and encourage new shoots.  
  - Mulch to retain soil moisture.  
  - Fertilize lightly in spring with compost or balanced fertilizer.  
- **Pests/Diseases**: Susceptible to powdery mildew, aphids, and currant borers.  
- **Companion Plants**: Do well with garlic, onions, and herbs like chives nearby. Avoid planting near white pines (which host blister rust).

## Harvesting
- **Days to Maturity**: 1–3 years after planting for first fruit, full production by year 4–5.
- **Season**: Mid-summer (June–July depending on climate).
- **Signs of Readiness**: Berries are bright red, juicy, and easily detach from clusters.
- **Harvest Method**: Pick entire clusters at once for best storage.
