# Black Currants (Ribes nigrum)

Black currants are perennial shrubs producing clusters of dark purple-black berries with a rich, tart flavor. They are extremely high in vitamin C and prized for preserves, cordials, syrups, and wine.

## Planting
- **When to Plant**: Plant bare-root or potted bushes in early spring or late fall while dormant.
- **Soil Needs**: Moist, well-drained, fertile soil, pH 6.0–6.5. Tolerates heavier soils.
- **Spacing & Depth**: Space 4–5 feet apart in rows 6–8 feet apart. Plant slightly deeper than nursery depth to encourage new shoots.
- **Sun & Water**: Partial shade is ideal (berries can scorch in hot full sun). Require steady moisture.

## Growing
- **Maintenance**:  
  - Mulch heavily to conserve moisture.  
  - Prune annually, removing oldest stems to encourage new wood.  
  - Fertilize lightly in spring.  
- **Pests/Diseases**: Powdery mildew, aphids, currant borer. Black currants are resistant to many issues affecting red currants.  
- **Companion Plants**: Do well with garlic, onions, and herbs. Avoid planting near white pines (risk of blister rust).

## Harvesting
- **Days to Maturity**: 2–3 years after planting for first crops, full yields by year 4–5.
- **Season**: Mid to late summer (July–August).
- **Signs of Readiness**: Berries turn deep black, soft, and aromatic.
- **Harvest Method**: Pick entire clusters at once. Handle gently — they crush easily.

## Long-Term Storage
- **Fresh Storage**: Refrigerate up to 1–2 weeks. Best stored unwashed until use.

  - **Cordials & Syrups** (classic black currant cordial).  
  - **Wine & Liqueurs** (e.g., crème de cassis).  
  - **Freezing**: Spread berries on tray, then bag.  
  - **Drying**: Use dehydrator for tea blends or snacks.  
- **Do Not Store With**: Apples, pears, or bananas (ethylene speeds spoilage).
