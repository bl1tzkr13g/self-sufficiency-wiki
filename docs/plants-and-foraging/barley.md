## Growing Barley

### Soil and Climate
- Prefers **cool weather** and **well-drained soil**.  
- pH range: **6.0â€“7.5**  
- Can tolerate **light frost** and even marginal soils.  
- Avoid heavy clay that retains water.

### Planting Time
- **Spring barley:** Plant as soon as the soil can be worked.  
- **Winter barley:** Sow in the **fall**, about 6â€“8 weeks before the first frost, to overwinter.

### Spacing & Depth
- Sow **1â€“1.5 inches deep**.  
- Space seeds **1â€“2 inches apart** in rows **6â€“7 inches** apart.  
- Typical seeding rate: **100â€“120 lbs per acre** (or ~1 oz per 10 square feet for small plots).

### Care
- Keep soil **evenly moist** during germination.  
- Once established, barley is **drought-tolerant**.  
- Avoid over-fertilizing â€” excess nitrogen encourages lodging (falling over).

2. Bundle and tie into **sheaves**, standing them upright to **dry in the sun** for 7â€“10 days.  
3. **Thresh** by beating or treading to release the grains.  
4. **Winnow** to remove chaff â€” toss into a light breeze or use a fan.
